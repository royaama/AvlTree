AVL Tree Implementation
A self-balancing binary search tree implemented in C, supporting insertion, deletion, and search operations with O(log n) complexity.  

Features:
- Insertion, deletion, and search operations.
- Automatic rebalancing using rotations (left, right, left-right, right-left).
- Efficient height management to ensure logarithmic complexity.
